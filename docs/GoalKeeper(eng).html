Time keeper tool for marathon runner.
Application checks time and distance and calculates required pace.
Did you write time/distance/pace on you arm ? You can get these information from the App.
And it tells you updated required pace.

App gets distance information by GPS ( or HealthKit ).
Pressing button, you can adjust distance to pre-set check-poing.
Time is after start-time. Basically app is clock. You can't stop clock.

Main screen has information from start and previous point, information to next point and goal.
Information is distance, time and actual/required pace.
Additonal information, advanced or hehind time is shown at previous check-point.

Check-point has distance from start and time. Time could be gate time or your target time.
Gate time is not editable on the fly. Target time is OK to change.
Target time could be net time or gross time.

You can adjust target goal time and pace on the fly. on adjust panel.
And adjust unit is settable in preference page.

Too much information could make it hard to read.
You can hide some. Some of previous information and hint labels.

Default method of running distance is GPS. And HealthKit is OK to use.
HealthKit could have delay and larger error.
And another way, constant mode. Distance is calculated by time with pre-set pace.

Logging actual time is not scope of the app.
But you can save time and refer it for later races.

Caution:
Even though there are reduction of display items, much information might confuse you.
Please use app before your race to familier app.
App has const mode, App runs automatically like demonstration.

Self review:
Gating time is not tight and it's ultra marathon. Main purpose of app was memo of aid-stations.
I think if it's tight race, checking race could help me.
